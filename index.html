      New York, New York—Last month, the New York City Council <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3331728&GUID=F4C311B2-837C-4841-9883-D89BF8BFEBA3&Options=&Search=">passed a law </a> that would require the Department of Education to collect health data disaggregated by children who are experiencing homelessness and those who are not. It would be the first time the city is able to compile health data on students who are experiencing homelessness—hopefully a first step in better addressing these student’s needs. Next, the mayor is expected to sign the law, and it would go into effect immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past ten years, the number of students experiencing homelessness has almost doubled, from 62,5921 in the 2009-2020 school year, to more than 100,000 this past year. People experiencing homelessness are three to six times more likely to become ill than a person with stable housing, according to data from the National Coalition for the Homeless. This new law would allow the city to know if students experiencing homelessness are living with asthma, diabetes, allergies or are overweight, among other things.

      This past school year, in 2019-2020, almost 100,000 students in public schools experienced homelessness (without accounting for charter schools). Those students though aren’t evenly spread out throughout the city. The schools most affected by student homelessness are also schools that have higher rates of Black and/or Hispanic students.

      In   <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5927513_The_Health_of_Homeless_Children_Revisited">"The Health of Homeless Children Revisited"</a>, Roy Grant et al., note that children who are experiencing homeless are less likely to be receiving the health care they need: “Combined with a high rate of under-immunization, the data strongly suggested that homeless children did not have access to preventive healthcare”
      <br>
      <br>
      Nonetheless, it will still be a challenge to collect this health data in schools, as many students experiencing homelessness have trouble attending school. As their study notes, “School attendance for homeless children is frequently disrupted because of moves among unstable housing situations and shelters and logistic problems of transportation, obtaining school books and clothes, space to do homework, and so on.”
